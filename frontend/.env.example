# API base URL — used when the Vite dev-server proxy is not available
# (e.g. in production or when running outside of `npm run dev`)
#
# In Docker, the nginx gateway handles routing so this is not needed.
# For local development with `npm run dev`, the Vite proxy in vite.config.ts
# forwards /api to localhost:8000 automatically.
